I'm following a react course from Udemy of ~ 40 hours. I might upload some of the modules here, mostly for me to see the different versions and easily be able to locate the added features to a project during the course.

Please ignore the "security" alerts. Some of the packages are not of the newest version and the course offers template projects, with older version of the npm packages.
